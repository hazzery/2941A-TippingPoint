# 2941A-TippingPoint

Hello, I am Harry and I was in high school VRC team 2941A. Welcome to my git repository for the 2021 - 2022 season Tipping Point.

The 2941 team is based out of Otumoetai College in New Zealand.
The three members of my team have competed in the VRC high school division since the start of In The Zone.
